1. rs_all_peaks & rs_all_peaks are very unstable

2. why not use just sklearn


Scienfic questions:

* take just one cluster out and cluster on it
* dimension of domains, why not hexagon https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0059662
* cluster of q, (cluster of I(q) due to tilt and shifting)
* two results of clusterings basically depending on whether removing outlets, 
- all_peaks_1 with average q
- all_peaks_1 without outlet with average q
- spread of all_peaks_1 

other ways of preprocessing is similar

I(q) not work very well due to due to tilt and shifting

see if I can find the center cluster by zooming the center area, in previous is able to

The updates are from Slide 29 to 41
1. Strain are now quantified using the area of unit cell in the real space relative to the average unit cell. I also add the error plot for the 95 % confidence interval to show the "statistical signficiance" of the jumps at different temperatures.
2. There is a new analysis on a set of new data, which is featured by a better quality and homogeneneity. From the conventional analysis based on the spatially averaged diffraction pattern, one can see the evolution of the neucleation of NC CDW from 190K to 202K. 
3. In the GMM clustering, similar spatial patterns of clusters are observed, which is consistent with the conventional based on the density of discommensuration.
4. The strain mapping analysis indicates the same trend as before, i.e. tensile (compressive ) strain favors NC CDW (CCDW).

Benchmark:
1. direct comparison of bragg peaks
2. from bragg peaks to reciprocal unit vectors along each direction
3. sweep real space positions, focused on range
4. thermal trend
