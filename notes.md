1. rs_all_peaks & rs_all_peaks are very unstable

2. why not use just sklearn


Scienfic questions:

* take just one cluster out and cluster on it
* dimension of domains, why not hexagon https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0059662
* cluster of q, (cluster of I(q) due to tilt and shifting)
* two results of clusterings basically depending on whether removing outlets, 
- all_peaks_1 with average q
- all_peaks_1 without outlet with average q
- spread of all_peaks_1 

other ways of preprocessing is similar

I(q) not work very well due to due to tilt and shifting
